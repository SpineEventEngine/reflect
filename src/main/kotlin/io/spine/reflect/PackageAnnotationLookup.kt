/**
 * Locates an annotation of type [T] for the [given][getFor] package, or
 * for any of its parental packages.
 *
 * This lookup is similar to [AnnotatedPackages][io.spine.reflect.AnnotatedPackages].
 *
 * [AnnotatedPackages][io.spine.reflect.AnnotatedPackages] eagerly traverses
 * all loaded packages during the instance creation. It looks for ones
 * that are annotated with the given annotation type, remembers them,
 * and then allows retrieving of an annotation for the asked package.
 *
 * But as more classes are loaded by the classloader, more new packages appear.
 * As a result, data within the collection becomes outdated. An instance does not
 * know about every currently loaded package.
 *
 * This implementation performs searching on demand with caching.
 * It does the actual search for packages that are asked for the first time.
 * The search result is remembered, so consequent requests for the previously
 * searched packages do not need an actual search.
 *
 * ## Caching
 *
 * When the lookup inspects parental packages, they are also all cached.
 * Since we have already fetched the loaded parental packages (or tried
 * to force-load them), there is no reason not to cache them too.
 *
 * Traversing and caching of parental packages will continue even if we have
 * already found the closest annotated parent. Checking two-three-five more
 * packages is not costly when instances of [Package] are already at hand.
 * Otherwise, it may cause many unnecessary repeated force-loadings.
 *
 * @param T The type of annotations this lookup searches for.
